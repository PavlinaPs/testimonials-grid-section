## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a nice practice on css grid. In mobile view there is only one column, in desktop view changed in @media to 2 row and 4 column grid.

### Continued development

I need to practise grid more often.

### Useful resources
